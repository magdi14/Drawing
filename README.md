# Drawing
is a simple C++ program to draw some shapes like staright lines, circles and curves using multiple algorithms.

## Lines:
1- Regular Line by computing slope.
2- Digital Differential Analyzer(DDA) Algorithm.
3- Midpoint Algorithms.

## Circles:
1- Quadratic Circles.
2- Polar Circles.
3- Bresenham Circles.

## Curves:
1- Parametric Curve.
2- Parabola Curve.
3- Hermite Curve.
4- Bezier Curve.

Also the program allows you to save the shapes you draw and load it again any time you want.
