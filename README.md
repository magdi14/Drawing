# Drawing
is a simple C++ program to draw some shapes like staright lines, circles and curves using multiple algorithms.

## Lines:
1- Regular Line by computing slope.<br />
2- Digital Differential Analyzer(DDA) Algorithm.<br />
3- Midpoint Algorithms.<br />
<br />
## Circles:
1- Quadratic Circles.<br />
2- Polar Circles.<br />
3- Bresenham Circles.<br />
<br />
## Curves:
1- Parametric Curve.<br />
2- Parabola Curve.<br />
3- Hermite Curve.<br />
4- Bezier Curve.<br />
<br />

Also the program allows you to save the shapes you draw and load it again any time you want.
